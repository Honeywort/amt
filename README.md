# Account Management Tool

## Who is this program for
A program for those who have a large number of accounts(sub-accounts) on exchanges (Binance and ByBit)

## What is this program for
The program allows you to transfer assets between the main account and sub-accounts. Transfers are made within the main account.

## Security of Your accounts
Security lies in your live API keys. And where you use the program.

## Supported exchanges
- Binance
- ByBit

## How it is working
At the moment the program uses exchange APIs to check balances. This does not happen quickly if you have many accounts.

## What is planned
It is planned to add exchanges (upon request). It is also planned to add web sockets.
